### Tic-tac-toe Game Features and Benefits

It is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of good sportsmanship and the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the searching of game trees. It is straightforward to write a computer program to play tic-tac-toe perfectly or to enumerate the 765 essentially different positions (the state space complexity) or the 26,830 possible games up to rotations and reflections (the game tree complexity) on this space. If played optimally by both players, the game always ends in a draw, making tic-tac-toe a futile game.

The game can be generalized to an m,n,k-game in which two players alternate placing stones of their own color on an m×n board, with the goal of getting k of their own color in a row. Tic-tac-toe is the (3,3,3)-game.Harary's generalized tic-tac-toe is an even broader generalization of tic-tac-toe. It can also be generalized as a nd game. Tic-tac-toe is the game where n equals 3 and d equals 2.It can be generalised even further by playing on an arbitrary incidence structure, where rows are lines and cells are points.

### Benefits

#### Good Sportsmanship

Like any game, tic tac toe also teaches a person to accept the defeat as well as ackowledge the win.

#### Prepares for more complex games

- The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

### *WHAT*

Tic-tac is a game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

### *WHY*

This classic game contribute to the children's development growth in numerous ways include their understanding of predictability, problem solving, spatial reasoning, hand eye coordination, turn taking and stratezing.

### *HOW*

- The game is to be played between two people .

- One of the player chooses ‘O’ and the other ‘X’ to mark their respective cells.

- The game starts with one of the players and the game ends when one of the players has one whole row/ column/ diagonal filled with his/her respective character (‘O’ or ‘X’).

- If no one wins, then the game is said to be draw.

# SWOT Analysis

## Advantage

These tic-tac-toe panels improve hand-eye coordination and encourage better social interaction by better collaborative play. And children shouldn't just play with other children. Parents also have a role in the playground more than being supervisors.

## Disadvantage

- Students may choose an easier path instead of finding a more challenging route. 
- Challenging on instructors and teachers to construct and grade all the different types of assignments.
